      <h2>Letter 01 – The Day I Missed You Most</h2>
      <p>
        My love, some nights are longer than others — and some feel endless because you’re not beside me.
        I imagine your voice, your laugh, your smile. I hold onto every word we’ve shared, and count the days until I can hold your hand again.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="letter">
      <h2>Letter 02 – What You Mean to Me</h2>
      <p>
        You are my favorite hello and hardest goodbye. Even though miles separate us, your presence fills my heart every day.
        You’re my comfort, my joy, my peace. I love you more than I could ever say.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="letter">
      <h2>Letter 03 – Future Dreams</h2>
      <p>
        I dream of a day when distance no longer exists between us. A home where your laughter echoes in our kitchen, your head rests on my shoulder every night, and we fall asleep knowing we’ve finally made it.
      </p>
